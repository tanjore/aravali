> An **educational framework/app** for those who want to apply and learn

## Idea
The idea is to create an application/platform where everything that we've learnt in the field of Computer Science comes into play and we use this knowledge to create interactive simulations and portray information in a better manner.

It can be termed as an **educational framework** where new topics and ideas can be showcased using code and thus bringforth learning and innovation.

## Features in pipeline

1. **Data Science Module**
Under this module, the wireframe would look as follows :


## Setting up the field :

Before I get to the main setup, I would like to discuss the current methodology and motivation for the same.

1. I believe in employing a [README-DRIVEN-]()
Currently, this software is in the planning phase where we're trying to fix up the playground and background information needed to implement the following set of features

## Motivation for the idea
I have experienced ( with whatever limited wisdom I have gained ) that software development methods and techniques are not being utilized ( or even if they are being put to play, they're being misused or under-utilized ) in most projects that are currently going on. I decided that I want some ideas to be put into play and wanted to go forward with the best practices which I could gather and research upon.

I want people to code and help out with this project and in-turn learn and revise their concepts. As a student, I believe, what one needs is exposure and experience with the best practices for a particular project. I want to provide a platform for the same with a community-driven approach for software development with the latest tools deployed in place.
